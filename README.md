# Bankruptcy Detection

## Description

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict company bankruptcy using data from the "Company Bankruptcy Prediction" dataset.

## Baseline

The baseline (reference model) will be a simple model that acts as a comparison and is easy to explain. In addition, the baseline will be based on the dataset to create the actual model.

## Scope

The scope of this project is just a proof of concept for the subject. Other models can be trained using different techniques and machine learning algorithms. The final result will be a model capable of predicting company bankruptcy with reasonable accuracy.

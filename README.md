# Bankruptcy Detection

## Description

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict company bankruptcy using data from the "Company Bankruptcy Prediction" dataset.

## Baseline

The baseline (reference model) will be a simple model that acts as a comparison and is easy to explain. In addition, the baseline will be based on the dataset to create the actual model.

## Scope

The scope of this project is just a proof of concept for the subject. Other models can be trained using different techniques and machine learning algorithms. The final result will be a model capable of predicting company bankruptcy with reasonable accuracy.

## Questions 

The dataset you mentioned is the “Company Bankruptcy Prediction” dataset, which was uploaded by the user “fedesoriano” on Kaggle1. This dataset contains bankruptcy data from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999-20091.

The problem addressed by this dataset is the prediction of company bankruptcy using machine learning techniques.
There are several notebooks already developed on Kaggle that use this dataset to predict company bankruptcy. Some examples include “Bankruptcy Prediction using Machine Learning” by the user “Siddharth Suresh” and “Bankruptcy Prediction using Neural Networks” by the user “Siddharth Suresh” .
Both of these notebooks contain the minimum necessary to train and save a model. The first notebook uses a Random Forest classifier to predict company bankruptcy, while the second notebook uses a Neural Network to make predictions.

# Bankruptcy Detection

## Description

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict company bankruptcy using data from the "Company Bankruptcy Prediction" dataset.

## Baseline

The baseline (reference model) will be a simple model that acts as a comparison and is easy to explain. In addition, the baseline will be based on the dataset to create the actual model.

## Scope

The scope of this project is just a proof of concept for the subject. Other models can be trained using different techniques and machine learning algorithms. The final result will be a model capable of predicting company bankruptcy with reasonable accuracy.

## Questions


The problem addressed by this dataset is the prediction of company bankruptcy using machine learning techniques.
There are several notebooks already developed on Kaggle that use this dataset to predict company bankruptcy. Some examples include “Bankruptcy Prediction using Machine Learning” by the user “Siddharth Suresh” and “Bankruptcy Prediction using Neural Networks” by the user “Siddharth Suresh” .
Both of these notebooks contain the minimum necessary to train and save a model. The first notebook uses a Random Forest classifier to predict company bankruptcy, while the second notebook uses a Neural Network to make predictions.


## How to create and activate a virtual environment in windows and linux

## Windows
Open the command prompt (cmd) or PowerShell.
Make sure you have Python and pip installed. You can check if they are installed by running the commands python --version and pip --version. If they are not installed, you can download them from the official Python website.
Install the virtualenv package using the command pip install virtualenv.
Create a new virtual environment by running the command virtualenv [environment_name], replacing [environment_name] with the name you want to give to your virtual environment.
Activate the virtual environment by running the command [environment_name]\Scripts\activate, replacing [environment_name] with the name you gave to your virtual environment.
Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install packages from a requirements.txt file using the command pip install -r requirements.txt. Make sure to specify the correct path to the requirements.txt file.
## Linux
Open a terminal window.
Make sure you have Python and pip installed. You can check if they are installed by running the commands python3 --version and pip3 --version. If they are not installed, you can install them using your distribution’s package manager (e.g., apt-get install python3 python3-pip on Ubuntu).
Install the virtualenv package using the command pip3 install virtualenv.
Create a new virtual environment by running the command virtualenv [environment_name], replacing [environment_name] with the name you want to give to your virtual environment.
Activate the virtual environment by running the command source [environment_name]/bin/activate, replacing [environment_name] with the name you gave to your virtual environment.
Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install packages from a requirements.txt file using the command pip3 install -r requirements.txt. Make sure to specify the correct path to the requirements.txt file.

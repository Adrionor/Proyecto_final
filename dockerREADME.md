# Project Instructions

This README.md file contains instructions for building, running, debugging, making predictions, and copying logs in the containerized application.

## Build the Image

To build the Docker image, run the following command:

```python
bash docker build -t final_project .
```

## Check the images 

to check the docker images run the following command

```python
 docker images
```

## Run the Container

To run the Docker container, execute the following command:

```python
bash docker run -d --rm --name final_project-container -p 3000:8000 final_project
```


##Check the container information

to check this run the following command

```python
docker ps -a

```

## Debug the Container

To access the running container and debug it, use the following command:

```python
bash docker exec -it final_project-container bin bash
```


## Make Predictions on the Local Machine

To make predictions on the local machine using the containerized application, execute the following command:

```python
bash curl http://localhost:3000/predict
```



## Copy Logs from the Container to the Local Machine

To copy logs from the container to the local machine, run the following command:

```python
docker cp bb2de4836286:debug.log .
```




## Check Debug Logs

To check the debug logs of the container, you can use the following command:

```python
docker logs -f bb2de4836286 | Select-String -Pattern "Debug"
```


This command will display the logs generated by the container, including any debug information.

Please ensure that you are in the same directory as the Dockerfile when running these commands.

## Docker Compose


## Create the network

First, create the network AIService by running this command:

## Run Docker Compose

Be sure you are un the directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located

Run next command to start the Server and Frontend APIs
```python
docker-compose up --build
```

## Run the following code to identify the CONTAINER ID of the Server container.

```python
docker ps -a
```


## Save the logs to the local machine

```python
docker cp bb2de4836286:debug.log .
```
